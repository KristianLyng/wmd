/* Basic parameter support for wmd.
 *
 * WMD allows setting and reading parameters from various sources (in
 * theory) and therefor needs a reasonably generic and flexible interface
 * to make sure the values are sane.
 *
 * Verify, verify, verify and then make sure that you can't access these
 * values without verifying them some more. But make it easy.
 *
 * We want as few entry-points the parameters as possible to assure a
 * consistent behavior.
 *
 * XXX: We may want to split the actual values into it's own file to avoid
 * 	mixing the values of the parameters and the framework to use it.
 *
 * XXX: A param-test framework should be included to dry-run param-changes.
 * 	This is particularly important for bindings.
