Work-in-progress file (Almost the same as "TODO" except it's actually being
done).

Note: This file is used use to generate WIP.h based on all lines starting
with a dash, so keep those lines C-safe (ie: no "). It turns out it serves
as a nice way to discipline yourself in how much you aim for: If the list
is too large, it will be annoying to run wmd, which encourages you to
prioritize the list.
